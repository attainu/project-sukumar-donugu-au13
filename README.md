# Junk File Organizer

## Overview
  Everyone has their own favorite methodology of organizing and filing, and it’s all too easy to get into “My Way is Better than Your Way” arguments .The reality is that there is no perfect way of getting things organized.

## Functionality of the code


```bash
1.Organize by extension
2.Organize by size
3.Organize by date

```

## Usage

```python

I used many built-in libraries like- shutil for file movement,datetime for
get the date of the files,argparse for the command line parsing and
etc.

```

## Things that going to perform in the program -
1. Organize by extension by using this option user can organize their files by their file extension in a given folder, folder will be created according to file extension and finally all files will be moved to a created folder.
2.	Organize by size by using this option user can organize their files by their file size, according to file sizes random folders will be created and respective files will be moved to them.
3.	Organize by date by using this option user can organize their files by date. Random folders will be created according to files based on date and files will be moved to them



## Note
If user wants junk file instead of well organized file then the program is going to perform that task and if user organize a file with different type by mistake then the programmer can organize that in their choice. If user fails to provide the exact path then the program tells us to provide valid path to be executed.

## Future Improvements
We can design the UI for the program so a normal user can easily interact with it. We can add more features like deleting the junk files after a certain period of time..!!
